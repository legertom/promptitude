# Promptitude
Promptitude is a job board for posting and finding jobs related to writing prompts for AI. It is built using Ruby 3.1.0 and Rails 7, and is open-source for others to contribute to.

## Installation
To install and run Promptitude locally, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository.
- Install the required gems using bundle install.
- Set up the database using rails db:create and rails db:migrate.
- Start the server using rails server.
- Open localhost:3000 in your browser.
### Usage

Users can view and post jobs related to writing prompts for AI on Promptitude. Jobs can be filtered by category, location, and job type. Users can also create an account to save jobs and receive notifications about new job postings.

To post a job, users must create an account and log in. From there, they can create a new job posting with a title, description, category, job type, location, and salary. Once the job is posted, it will be visible to other users.

- Apply for jobs directly through the website.
- Integration with popular AI platforms to make it easier for job seekers to find relevant jobs.
